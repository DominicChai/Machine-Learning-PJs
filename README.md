# Machine-Learning-PJs

Here are some machine learning projects I did in Text Mining on Massive User Comments in Electronic Commerce Platform, Image Classification, Credit Assessment and Credit Rating in P2P Lending and Evaluation on the Sustainability of Cities. The main techniques and models are: Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forrest, BP Neural Net and Convolution Neural Net, Word2Vec and Doc2Vec and also LDA topic model.
